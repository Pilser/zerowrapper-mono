    "Template materials are PUBLIC, VERSIONED, reusable serverless apps.\n\
     \n\
     Every template version is an isolated serverless board addressed as <template_id>@<version>.\n\
     Versions are immutable; they live under templates/<template_id>/versions/<version>/ with a\n\
     manifest.json, changelog.md (why a version exists) and diff.json (what changed), plus files/.\n\
     The version's own DB holds its schema and records (sessions/<tpl>@<ver>/<tpl>@<ver>.db).\n\
     \n\
     Lifecycle:\n\
     - create  -> an empty template v1 (a name, kind and description in the public registry).\n\
     - publish -> promote one of YOUR session boards to a new template v1 (config + data + files).\n\
     - embed   -> reference a version WITHOUT copying: shared live data. No own board, no files.\n\
     - clone   -> copy a version into your session: your own files copy + data snapshot in a board.\n\
     - commit  -> publish your clone's changes as the next version (vN+1) with a changelog.\n\
     - update  -> move an existing clone/embed to a newer version.\n\
     \n\
     Rule of thumb: embed if you only need to point at shared data; clone if the data is YOURS;\n\
     commit if you improved a clone and want the world to have it.\n\
     Every material reference is pinned to <template_id>@<version> so dependents never break.";
